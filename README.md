# WebDevPROJECTS
Welcome to My Web dev projects!

Here, I want to showcase my passion for web development, and my skills and show that I can create websites. Although, they are all still in progress.

Anyway...

Preview my Agreeculturist site here (Please note that this website requires running a backend server and cannot be hosted directly on GitHub Pages. Some features and functions may not work at all.): <br />
